# CSE-140-Single_Cycle-MIPS-SIMULATOR

This project was worked on by UC Merced students, Nicholas Manzano and Denicia Delizo for CSE-140 Computer Architecture. 
To run simply compile the c++ file, run the .exe, and see the output. 
  Make sure to have the sampe_binary.txt in the same directory as the c++ file.
