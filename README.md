# CSE-140-Single_Cycle-MIPS-SIMULATOR

This project was worked on by UC Merced students, Nicholas Manzano and Denicia Delizo for CSE-140 Computer Architecture. 
To run simply compile the c++ file, run the .exe, and type in "sample_binary.txt" as the input. 
Make sure to have the sampe_binary.txt in the same directory as the c++ and .exe files.

Ex:
compile:  "g++ -std=c++11 -o a.exe single_cycle.cpp"
run:      "./a.exe"
input:    "sample_binary.txt"
